# Main Idea
This project is divided into 3 independent parts. You can access each one of them by following the instructions below.

# Impact

The main `index.html` includes the impact component using an [html-include]. The corresponding files are organized as follows:

- **HTML**: Located in the `html` folder under the name `impactV2.html`.
- **CSS**: The stylesheet can be found in `impactV2.css`.
- **JavaScript**: The script is available in the `JS` folder under the name `impactV2.js`.
- **Dataset**: The dataset is embedded in the JavaScript file. If you prefer to see it in Excel format, it is available in the `data` folder.
