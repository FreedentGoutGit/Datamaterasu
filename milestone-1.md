# Datamaterasu - Milestone 1


## Dataset
Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization.

The following are some datasets that we plan to explore:

* [ourworldindata.org - CO2 and GHG Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions#explore-data-on-co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions) ([direct link](https://github.com/owid/co2-data)) (Carbon dioxide and GHG emissions from fossil fuels and industry, by country)
* [Carbon Footprints of World Cities](https://www.citycarbonfootprints.info/) ([direct link - absolute emissions](https://www.citycarbonfootprints.info/GGMCF_top500cities.txt), [direct link - per capita](https://www.citycarbonfootprints.info/GGMCF_top500citiesPercap.txt)) (model of carbon footprint estimates of individual cities across 189 countries)
* [CCUS Projects Database](https://www.iea.org/) ([direct link](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/ccus-projects-database#)) (list of existing Carbon Capture Usage & Storage initiatives in place worldwide since the 1970s)


Some additional, reduced-scope datasets we may explore and use in the project:
* [USA EIA - CO2 Emissions from Electricity Generation](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data.php#elecenv) (Carbon dioxide emissions as a result of electricity generation in the USA)
* [Toronto, Canada - GHG Emissions by Sector](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/environmentally-friendly-city-initiatives/transformto/sector-based-emissions-inventory/) (GHG emissions by industry sector in the city of Toronto)
* [New York, USA - Statewide GHG Emissions](https://data.ny.gov/Energy-Environment/Statewide-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-Beginning-1990/5i6e-asw6/about_data) (GHG emissions for the state of New York)
* [IGES NDC Database](https://www.iges.or.jp/en/pub/iges-indc-ndc-database/en) ([direct link](https://www.iges.or.jp/en/publication_documents/pub/data/en/5005/IGES+NDC+Database_v7.7.xlsx)) (Summary of main climate pledges and NDCs of signatories of the Paris Agreement)

These datasets are provided in simple formats (generally csv or xlsx) that make the data easy to import and use directly without much cleaning.

## Problematic
Following the 2015 Paris agreement, 195 nations agreed to the long-term goal of keeping the rise in mean global temperature to well below 2 Â°C.

However efforts worldwide have not proven to be sufficient, "much more to be done" to achieve net 0 targets [according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://www.politico.eu/article/paris-agreement-goals-failed-climate-change-global-warming-united-nations-climate-review/).

An essential tool to promote the development of  to visualize provide policymakers with regular scientific assessments on climate change, its implications and potential future risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation options.
