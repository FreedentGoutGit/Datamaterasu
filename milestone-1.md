# Datamaterasu - Milestone 1


## Datasets
Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization.

The following are some datasets that we plan to explore:

* [ourworldindata.org - CO2 and GHG Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions#explore-data-on-co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions) ([direct link](https://github.com/owid/co2-data)) (Carbon dioxide and GHG emissions from fossil fuels and industry, by country)
* [Carbon Footprints of World Cities](https://www.citycarbonfootprints.info/) ([direct link - absolute emissions](https://www.citycarbonfootprints.info/GGMCF_top500cities.txt), [direct link - per capita](https://www.citycarbonfootprints.info/GGMCF_top500citiesPercap.txt)) (model of carbon footprint estimates of individual cities across 189 countries)
* [CCUS Projects Database](https://www.iea.org/) ([direct link](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/ccus-projects-database#)) (list of existing Carbon Capture Usage & Storage (CCUS) initiatives in place worldwide since the 1970s)
* [AR6 IPCC report databrowser-Temperature projections](https://ipcc-data.org/ar6landing.html)([direct link](https://ipcc-browser.ipcc-data.org/browser/dataset/6397/0)) (datasets for the projection of different variables depending on various plausible emission rates)

Some additional, reduced-scope datasets we may explore and use in the project:
* [USA EIA - CO2 Emissions from Electricity Generation](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data.php#elecenv) (Carbon dioxide emissions as a result of electricity generation in the USA)
* [Toronto, Canada - GHG Emissions by Sector](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/environmentally-friendly-city-initiatives/transformto/sector-based-emissions-inventory/) (GHG emissions by industry sector in the city of Toronto)
* [New York, USA - Statewide GHG Emissions](https://data.ny.gov/Energy-Environment/Statewide-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-Beginning-1990/5i6e-asw6/about_data) (GHG emissions for the state of New York)
* [IGES NDC Database](https://www.iges.or.jp/en/pub/iges-indc-ndc-database/en) ([direct link](https://www.iges.or.jp/en/publication_documents/pub/data/en/5005/IGES+NDC+Database_v7.7.xlsx)) (Summary of main climate pledges and NDCs of signatories of the Paris Agreement)

These datasets are provided in simple formats (generally csv or xlsx) that make the data easy to import and use directly without much cleaning.

## Problematic
The 2015 Paris Agreement marked a global commitment to limit the rise in global temperatures to well below 2Â°C. Despite this ambition, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) highlights that current efforts [fall short of the necessary actions to achieve net-zero targets](https://www.politico.eu/article/paris-agreement-goals-failed-climate-change-global-warming-united-nations-climate-review/).

Data visualization is recognized as a key strategy to guide climate action effectively. The IPCC emphasizes the value of using regular scientific assessments to inform policymakers about climate change, its consequences, and strategies for adaptation and mitigation. However, the existing visual aids, such as those in IPCC reports, can be complex and lengthy, making them challenging for a broader audience to engage with.

Interactive graphs offer a solution by providing a clear, global perspective on crucial areas needing improvement, from reducing CO2 emissions to advancing Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technologies. Visual representations on world maps that detail GHG emissions, temperature forecasts, and CCUS projects can play a vital role in the climate battle, helping to make the challenges and solutions more understandable to everyone.

Our goal is to bridge the gap between projected climate scenarios and practical actions, showcasing where and how efforts can be most effectively applied.

## Exploratory Data Analysis


## Related Work
[IPCC 6th report](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/)
* The most comprehensive effort so far by the scientific community to understand the consequences of human created climate change and potential solutions. Lot's of interesting visualizations, but super lengthy and a pain to read.

[IPCC interactive Atlas](https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch/)
* An interactive atlas for visualization of emissions and temperature projections. Does not include any potential solutions, or more local visualizations (city level ect.)

[CCUS Map](https://ccusmap.com/)
* Visualization of active CCUS ventures. Main features blocked behind a paywall. Not very nice looking. No projections

[Our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions)
* Our world in data has a lot of detailed analysis of GHG and CO2 emission metrics, with interesting interactive graphs. Very specific topics are covered each time, links are harder to find.
